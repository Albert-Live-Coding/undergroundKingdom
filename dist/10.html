    <p>You stand there and watch as the strange crea-ture  walks slowly toward you.  Then  you see  thelarge,  blue-white pieces of broken shell.  This an-gel  bird is only  a  fledgling,  just hatched!
        Losing  your  fear,  you  walk  up  and  stroke  thecreature  gently.  It cocks its  head to the side  andtouches you with one of its wings. At that momentit seems  almost human.
        But suddenly  you  hear a loud  whirring sound.Hovering  above  you  is  another  angel  bird,  amuch  larger  one.  It  must  be  the  mother  of  thefledgling.  She swoops toward you.</p>
