    <p>Now  you  stand  at  the  edge, lost  in  thoughtHow could the crevasse have no bottom? Could itreally lead  to an  underground  kingdom?  Whathappened  to Dr.  Vivaldi?
        But  your  thoughts are shattered. You  didn'tseem to  slip, yet  suddenly you are  falling  into  thecrevasse!  A  ledge  is  coming  up  fast beneath you.You  could  land  on  it,  but  you're  falling  so  fastyou're  sure  to  be  badly  injured. You  might onlybe  saving  yourself for  a  slow,  agonizing  death.
        These  thoughts  race  through  your  head  in  asplit  second</p>
