        "No, thank you, Professor,"  you say.  "I've seenenough.  I  never want to  get near the  BottomlessCrevasse  again."
        Bruckner shrugs.  "I understand," he says as heholds  out his  hand.
        From  then  on,  you  follow  the  news  eagerly,hoping  to  hear  some  report  on  Professor  Bruck-ner's  expedition.  One  day,  passing  a  newsstand,you see a headline that makes your heart sink:
        PROFESSOR  AND PARTY MISSING INWORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS ICE FIELDS!
        In  the months  that  follow  you  hear  nothingfurther about the  Bottomless  Crevasse,  until  onenight,  watching the  news,  you  hear an  interviewwith  two  scientists  who  claim  to  have  picked  upradio  signals  coming from inside  the  earth. "Wecan't  explain  their  seemingly  impossible  origin,"one  of them  reports, "nor  can  we  decipher  themessage,  except  for two  words, All Safe."The next morning you call ProfessorBruckner's  office  at  the  National  Research  In-stitute.  "I was wondering whether there were anyplans  for  another  expedition  to  the  BottomlessCrevasse,"  you say.
