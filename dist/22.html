        <p>Your strongest desire now is to be home  again.You cling tightly to the angel bird. As if it knowswhat  you're  thinking,  it  rises  in  the  air,  bankssteeply,  and then,  accelerating,  hurtles into a cor-ridor within the  ground.  You  nestle  into its thickdowny coat as it streaks through the darkness. Allthe  while  you  feel  completely  safe,  and  in  timeyou sleep.
            When  you  awake,  it  is  much  colder.  A  chillwind  bites  against your  body.  The  brightness  ofthe world around you is not the warm red light ofthe  Underground  Kingdom,  but  the  cold  whitelight  of  the  Arctic. The barren landscape,pocketed with ice and snow, is a familiar scene, asis the rude village of shacks and tin-roofed build-ings nearby.  You're  in  Greenland!  The village  isthe  coastal  settlement from which  your party be-gan its trek across the ice fields to the BottomlessCrevasse</p>
