            A few tides later you and Dr. Vivaldi set out forthe Weightless Peaks.  With you is a young Arch-pod  named  Katu, chosen  because  she  speaksyour  language.
            On  the  trek  from  the  Archpod  village  to  theWeightless Peaks, Katu tells you the legend of theArchpods who traveled through a shaft that led toa  new  universe.  Few  Archpods  believed  therecould be such a place. Most of them thought thatthe  earth  was  infinitely  thick,  that  nothing  couldlie beyond it.  "Now that human  beings  have  ar-rived,  we  know that  there  is  a  whole  new worldright  under  our  feet.  We  call  your  world  theNether World,"  she says.  "We are curious aboutit.  But we are also afraid of it, and of its creatureswho  could  destroy  us."
            "Sometimes  we  human  beings  are  afraid  ofourselves,"  you reply.
            After  hiking  for  fourteen  tides,  you  begin  toclimbâ€”first  gentle  hills,  then  steep  mountains.You  tire  under  the  weight  of your  pack,  but  Dr.Vivaldi urges you on.  "It will soon be easier,"  shesays.  And she is proven correct, for as you strug-gle  up  the  next  steep  hill,  you  feel  your  packgrowing lighter, and you feel lighter too. Ahead ofyou,  Katu is bounding up the higher peaks like amountain  gazelle.
