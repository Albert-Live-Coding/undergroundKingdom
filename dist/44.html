        The  interior  of  the  agon,  as  it  seems  to  becalled,  is  lit  by  glowing  stones  circling  the  innerwall.  In the center is a small fountain.  Clear waterbubbles  forth and  flows along  a silver  troughbefore  disappearing  underground. The  floor  issoft  and  spongy,  like  a thick  bed  of moss.
        The  leader steps  forward. "Ket,"  he says,pointing  to  himself. "Ket Raka."  Pointing  to  theothers,  he  says,  "Akim  Raka,  Tor  Raka  . . . "
        You  repeat  each  name,  then  pointing  to  your-self,  tell  them  your  name. The  Rakas  laugh  asthey  try  to  pronounce  the  strange  sound.
        Tor, who seems younger than the others, bringsyou  something  that  looks  like  cheese  but  tasteslike  honey.  Ket gives  you  a  small  pink  fruit.  "Ibtanga," he says,  smiling.
        Tanga is delicious, and you are eating a secondone  when  a  large  blue-furred  Raka  rushes  intothe  agon.  Pointing at you,  he speaks  excitedly inhis  own  tongue. Tor  begins  to  argue  with  him.The others join in.
        "Nar  mg  calla!"  the  blue-furred  Raka saysloudly. It's clear he wants you to come with him; itseems  likely that he represents  the chief, orleader.
        Ket  and  Akim  gesture  as  if you  should  obey.But Tor shakes  his  head,  warning you not to go.
