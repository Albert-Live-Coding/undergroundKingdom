            Certainly  the  Hills  of  Diamonds  must  be  anamazing sight And, if you ever do make it back tothe surface,  it wouldn't hurt to have a few dozendiamonds in your pocketsâ€”you could be rich forlife!
            The Archpods provide you and Dr. Vivaldi withtheir largest boat for the trip down the Great Riverto the  diamond  hills.After a journey of six tides,  you  hear a roaringup ahead.  The Archpods quickly beach the boat."We  can  go  no  farther,"  the  leader  tells  you."There  are  deep  canyons  and  fierce  rapidsahead.  We  must  go  on  foot  across  the  field  ofwhite clay."
            You  soon  find that the  white  clay is  extremelyhot.  Your feet would  burn  up  were  it not for thelight gravity of the underworld that permits you torace  across the field in great leaps.
            Finally you reach cooler ground. Ahead of youis a dazzling vision: dozens of little hills of brilliantdiamonds!
