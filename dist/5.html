    <p>Your  whole  body  is  racked  with  pain  as  youcrash onto the  ledge.  You're  shaken and bruisedbut still  alive!  A  snowbank cushioned your fall.
        "HELP!"  you cry."Hold on!" Larsen yells.  "It's going to be tricky,but we're  rigging our ropes.  We'll  get you up."
        You  feel  a  flash  of joy; then  you  remembersomething that chills you to the  bone.  You werevery  careful  not to fall in.  You're  quite  sure  youdidn't slip;  you were  pulled as  if by  an unknownforce  within the  Bottomless  Crevasse.
        Should you warn your friends about thestrange force? If you do, they may be afraid to getclose  enough  to  rescue  you</p>
