"We're  going  too  fast!  Can't we  slow  down?"you call.
"No. We have hundreds of miles to go. We'vegot to get through the earth's mantle fast,  or we'llbe baked to  death."  Bruckner's voice  is  cool  andreassuring.  Maybe  he  knows what he's  doing.
But  every  minute,  the  temperature  rises.  Youbegin  to  sweat.  Whatever  made  you  think  youcould survive such a trip?  Sipping cold lemonadefrom  a  plastic  bottle,  you  try  to  close  your  eyesand  relax. Then  it  seems  as  if the  Vertacraft  isslowing,  but you  can't be  sure.
Suddenly everything is  still.  The Vertacraft hascome  to  rest.  Looking  through  a  porthole,  yousee  that  you  have  landed  inside  a  large  crater.Slowly  you  climb  out  of  the  Vertacraft  and  openthe  other compartment.  Professor Bruckner's faceis ashen gray. You feel for his pulse. Nothing.  Thestrain  of the  descent  must  have  been  too  muchfor  his  heart.
