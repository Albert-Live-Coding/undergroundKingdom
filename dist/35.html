You  know  that  your  chances  of surviving  theexpedition  are  slim.  Even  if you  safely  descendinto the Bottomless Crevasse, there's no assurancethat  the  Vertacraft  will  be  able  to  get  you  outagain.  Still,  it's your only chance to find your lostfriends  and  to  explore  a  new world.
You  grit  your  teeth  and  climb  aboard. Theprofessor climbs  in  beside  you.
"Ready?"  he says.  "I'm going to activate us assoon  as  we're  centered."
"Ready."  You strap  yourself  in  and say  aprayer.  You feel  like  a larva inside a cocoon.Looking  through  the  port,  you watch  the  oth-ers position the  Vertacraft over the  crevasse.  Youwave at them, and they wave back. Suddenly youare falling—faster and faster, plummeting towardthe center of the earth. Has the Vertacraft goneout of control?
"Professor  Bruckner!" you  yell. "Won't  therockets work?  Can't you  slow us?"
"We're  saving  our  fuel,"  he  shouts. "Gravitywill  slow us—you'll  see."
Has  he gone  mad? You notice a red button onthe control  panel.  Next to it is a  sign that reads:
<span class="centerTxt">
