    <h1>WARNING!!!!</h1>
    <p>Do  not read this  book straight through  from  be-ginning to end! These pages contain many differ-ent adventures you can  have as you try to reachthe Underground Kingdom. From time to time asyou  read  along,  you  will  be  asked  to  make  achoice.  Your  choice  may  lead  to  success  or  todisaster!  The  adventures  you  have  will  be  theresult of the decisions you make.  After you makeyour  choice,  follow  the  instructions  to  see  whathappens  to  you  next.</p>
    <h2>SPECIAL WARNING!!!!</h2>
    <p>The Underground  Kingdom is not easy to reach.Many  readers  never  get  there.  Others  never  re-turn.
        Before  starting out on  your journey,  you  maywant to  read  Professor  Bruckner's  theory,  whichis  set forth  on the  pages  that follow.
        Professor  Bruckner  is  a  rather  boring  writer,and I wouldn't suggest that you bother to read histheory,  except that,  if you ever get to the Under-ground  Kingdom,  it might save your life.
        Good  luck!</p>
