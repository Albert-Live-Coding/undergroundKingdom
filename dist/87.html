            "Now you can see,"  says Dr. Vivaldi,  "how onthe  Weightless  Peaks  the  higher  you  go,  thelighter you'll get Look!" She points to the highestpeak of all.  Its top is a spire jutting into the sky. Athin  plume of smoke rises from the top.
            "It must be a volcano,"  you say."No,"  says  Dr.  Vivaldi. "Something  else  isgoing on.  The mountain's gravity at its peak is soweak that dust is being pulled off by the tremen-dous gravity  of the Black Sun."
            "I bet I only weigh five or six pounds," you say."I could easily climb to the top of that spire."
            "Better not,"  says Dr.  Vivaldi.You  realize  that  if  you're  so  light,  the  hugeboulders  around  you  can't weigh  very  much  ei-ther. You decide to test your theory. You nudge aboulder twice your size.  It rolls into another boul-der. Then  above  you, Katu  screams, "Ava-lanche!"
