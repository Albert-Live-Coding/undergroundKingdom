            Swimming  to  shore  looks  too  risky.  You  sitquietly in the boat, hoping for the best. As the warboat nears the middle of the river, the current getsstronger. The Raka  warriors  can hardly  rowagainst  it  As  the  Rakas  struggle  with  their  oars,the boat is swept farther and farther downstream.
            You  wonder  where  the  current  will  take  you,until  you  hear  a  sound  up  ahead  that  quicklygrows into a roar.
            "Ig riba!"  the  Rakas shout.  "Ig zaark!" Theybegin to unload the heavy brakpa. Frantically youhelp,  but  at  the  sight  of the  boiling  white  rapidsahead,  you  lose  heart.  Moments  later  the  boatsmashes  into  the  rocks,  and  you  and  the  Rakawarriors are  swept away by the  raging torrent.
