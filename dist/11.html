        You  dive  to  the  ground  and  shield  your  facewith  your arms,  hoping the  angel bird will  leaveyou  unharmed.
        Nothing  happens;  the  angel  bird  must  havetaken  her  young  one  away.  What's  more,  youbegin to have the feeling that you are completelysafe. Slowly  you  get  to  your  feet. Standingnearby are three more of the large creatures.  Oneof  them  effortlessly  leaves  the  ground,  glidesthrough the air, and lands beside you. You have astrong urge  to climb  on  its  back.
        Why  is  it  you  feel  so  safe?  The  angel  birdsbegin  to  make  musical  sounds,  more  beautifulthan anything you've ever heard.  Is it this musicthat  causes  your  good  feelings,  or  somethingmore? These creatures seem to communicate notin words,  or even  ideas,  but in feelings.
        Without  thinking  more  about  it,  you  leap  up,and because there's very little gravity,  you almostfloat  onto the creature's feathery back. You nestlein. It feels like a bed of goose down, soft and silky.</p>
