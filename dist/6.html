    <p>Once  again  you  brush  against  a  firm  surface.This time it's the floor of the cavern.  In fact,  youhave  touched  down  on  the  mossy  bank  of  anunderground  stream.  You  drink  from  the  cool,clear water,  then  step  out  of the  cavern  into  thisstrange  world.
        The only illumination is a dim red-orange glowthat seems to come from the ground. The air is soclear that you can see shadowy, curving hills andvalleys stretching out in all directions, even aboveyou.
        Why do you  feel so good? It must be becauseyou  are  so  light—you  could  hardly  weigh  morethan  ten  or  fifteen  pounds.  You  spring  to  yourfeet  Every movement is easy. You jump—twentyor  thirty  feet  high—and float  gently  to theground.
        Then you realize that you are not alone. Only afew yards away is an odd creature. As big as youare,  it  seems  to  be  some  kind  of  bird  yet  muchmore  than  a  bird.  Under a  crown  of soft  goldenfeathers  are  enormous  blue-green  eyes,  so vividand  intense  that  they  seem  to  be  not  only  ameans of vision,  but also a  means of power.
        There  is  something  terrifying  about  that  face,but also something angelic, something that drawsyou  to  it  In  fact,  you  feel  as  if  you  are  beinghypnotized by those eyes—eyes of an angel bird!</p>
