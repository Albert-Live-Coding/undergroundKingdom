        You  are  lying  on  a  hammock  woven  of  fineclima  vines.  You  feel  flushed  and  feverish,  yethappy: you're alive! Dr. Vivaldi is beside you. Shebrushes a  cool,  wet cloth  across your forehead.
        "Where  are  we?"  you  ask.  "How  did  we  getout of there?  Did you see the ghost wolf?"
        "We're  back  with  the  Archpods,"  Dr.  Vivaldisays,  smiling.  "And  I  did  see  a  great  beast  withtongues of fire, but in truth there was no wolf,  norany other beast  And the cracks in the field wereonly  a  few  inches  wide,  just  wide  enough  torelease a poisonous gas from beneath theground. A few whiffs of it was enough to make ushallucinate  and  have  the  most  horrible  night-mares.  It's fascinating that the  gas causes such  aspecific common  visionâ€”I'd like  to  research  thissome  more.  In  any  event,  we  were  lucky  to  beclose to the edge when I realized what was hap-pening, I was able to pull you away so you couldget  fresh  air."
        "Thanks,"  you say.  "After this I'm not going tobe  afraid  of  anything  in  the  Underground  King-dom."
        "That's  good,"  she  replies,  "because  we  stillhave  a whole  new  world to  explore!"
