            When you wake, Tomo gives you a bright pinktanga. You  hadn't  realized  how  little  you'veeaten,  and  you  wolf it down.  Smiling,  Tomo re-places it with  another.
            "Someday we will go hunting,"  says Tomo."Are you a  hunter?"
            "Almost.  I  must  first  go  on  the  Hunt  of  theBlack Sun.  I must kill a Kota beast."
            "A Kota beast? What are they?"Tomo  frowns. "Great  toothed  animals,  witheyes  like  blue  flames  and  teeth  like  iron  fangs.They  live  in  the  darkest,  hottest  parts  of  thewoods. They  tear  anything  apart,  even  them-selves."
            You  start  to  ask  about  the  Hunt  of  the  BlackSun, but Tomo raises a hand.  "Now we must talkof  war.  The  Archpods  will  not  expect  an  attackwhen the river is low. That is when we shall crossand  destroy  their  boats."
            The next morning as the Great River begins tofall, the Rakas load their hunting boat, now calledthe war boat, with brakpaâ€”crude bombs packedin  hollowed logs.  You  shudder to think that youare about to witness the beginning of a war.  Butthere seems to  be  no way to avoid it  Before  thesleeping  tide  has  ended,  Tomo,  you,  and  fivehunters set off in  the war boat
