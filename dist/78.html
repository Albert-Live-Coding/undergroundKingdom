            From  then  on  you  and  Dr.  Vivaldi  are  treatedlike  honored  guests. The  Archpods  bring  youbaskets heaped with tanga, and cakes made fromgolden  grain.  They show you their mineral poolswhere  you  swim  in  the  swirling,  bubbly  water.Later you lie in the warmth of the glowing rocks,then  cool  off under  the  Black  Sun.
            A few tides  later  the  Grand  Akpar pays  you  avisit.  "Would you  like  to stay longer and explorethe  Underground Kingdom?"  he asks.  "We shalllend  you  three  hunters  to  guide  you.  Or,  if youwish,  you  may return to the Nether World."
            "Which  do  you  prefer?"  Dr.  Vivaldi asks you."There  may  still  be  a  chance  to  return  home,though  the risks are  great."
