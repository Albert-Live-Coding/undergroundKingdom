    <h1>PROFESSORBRUCKNER'S THEORY</h1>
    <p>The  discovery  of the  Bottomless  Crevasse  in
        Greenland  by  Dr.  Nera  Vivaldi  supports  my
        theory that the earth is not solid,  as has been
        thought,  but that it is hollow.  The  Bottomless
        Crevasse  is  probably  the  sole  route  from  the
        earth's  surface  to  a  vast  "Underground  King-
        dom." The only other possible link would be an
        underground river, flowing in alternating direc-
        tions  in  response  to  the  tides,  but this  seems
        unlikely.
        How, you  may ask,  was the  earth hollowed
        out? My studies show that more than a billion
        years  ago  a  tiny  black  hole  collided  with  our
        planet  and  lodged  in  its  center,  pulling  the
        whole  molten  core  into  an  incredibly  massive
        sphere only a few hundred meters across.
        If you were to  stand on the inner surface of
        the  earth,  like  a  fly  on  the  inner  shell  of  an
        enormous  pumpkin,  you  would  see  the  black
        hole  directly overhead,  like a black sun.
        The  gravity  of the  earth's thick  shell  would
        hold you to the inner shell of the earth, though
        you would weigh much less than you would on
        the  outer  surface  because  the  mass  of  the
        Black Sun would tend to pull you toward it. If
        there were a very tall mountain in the  Under-
        ground Kingdom and you were to climb to the
        top of it, you might be pulled up into the Black
        Sun  because  gravity  gets  stronger  as  you  ap-
        proach  a massive  object.
        In  all  other  respects  the  Black  Sun  would
        not be  dangerous to  any creatures  in the  Un-
        derground  Kingdom.  On  the  contrary,  the
        Black  Sun  would  be  necessary  to  life  in  the
        underworld,  but  in  the  opposite  way that  the
        sun  is  necessary to  life  on the  earth's surface.
        Our sun gives us heat and keeps us from freez-
        ing. The Black Sun absorbs heat. If there is an
        underground kingdom, it is the Black Sun that
        keeps  its  inhabitants  from  being  baked  to
        death by the  heat within the  earth!</p>
