        "Get back from the edge!" you yell. "I didn'tfall, I was pulled in!"For  a  few  moments  you  hear  nothing; thenSneed yells,  "Thanks for warning  us.  There  maybe  some  force  here  we  don't  understand. Butdon't worry, we're rigging a brace so we can pullyou  up  without getting  too  close."
        A  few  minutes  later you  see  a  nylon  climbingrope dangling in front of you. You pull in enoughto  tie  around  your  waist  and  under  your  arms.Taking  a firm grip,  you  call  up  to  the  top,  "I'mreadyâ€”pull  away!"
        Your heart skips a beat as you're yanked off theledge.  You  dangle  for  a  moment;  then,  slowly,foot  by  foot,  your  friends  pull  you  up  over  theedge. You scramble across the ice into their arms.
        "Thank  goodness  we  got  you!"  says  Larsen."The Bottomless Crevasse is a killer.  I think we'dbetter  quit  now."
        "I agree.  I've  had enough,"  Sneed  says.After  what  you've  been  through,  you're  notabout to argue with them. The three of you packup and begin the long trek back across the glacier.You're  happy  to  be  alive, but  you  know  thatyou'll  always  regret  that  you  never  reached  theUnderground  Kingdom.</p>
