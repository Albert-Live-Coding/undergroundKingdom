        <p>
            You  shake  your head  and  stand  your  ground.The  blue-furred  Raka  glares  at  you  and  stridesfrom  the  agon.  He  returns  a  few  moments  laterwith two  other Rakas,  each  holding  ropes  and  anet.
            "I  won't  be  taken  captive  like  some  animal!"you  shout.
            A Raka tries to  rope you,  but you duck out ofreach.  They  draw closer.  Like  a football  quarter-back,  you  spin  and  dart  past them.
            "Kela! Zaark!" the  Rakas yell,  but you're  al-ready out of the agon, running across the dimly litland.
            Helped by the light gravity, you quickly reach agrove of cluster-leaf trees, and you keep running,on  and  on. At  last  you  reach  the  open  coun-tryside.  In  the  soft  reddish  gray  twilight  you  seethe Great River just ahead. You stop to rest besideits waters.
