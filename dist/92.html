            "I  think I  know why the Archpods  and Rakasavoid this beautiful land,"  says Dr.  Vivaldi.  "Theyare  conditioned  to  the  dim  red  light of the  GreatRiver  valley. The  broad  daylight  here  bothersMopur  as  much  as  it would  bother  us  to  live  insemidarkness."
            "Why is it so bright—?"You are interrupted by cries from Mopur."Clera! The Flying Clera!"
            Craning your neck,  you  see  several  great bird-like creatures  swooping across the  sky.
            "They  are  like  nothing  that  has  ever  lived  onthe  surface,"  says  Dr.  Vivaldi. "They  may  haveevolved  on  some  other  planet."
            You  fall  silent as the  music  of the  Flying Clerabegins—a  great  chorus  you  hear  not  only  withyour  ears,  but with your whole  body.
            Like you, Dr.  Vivaldi seems hypnotized.  "Theysound truly  angelic,"  she  says.
            But Mopur tugs at your sleeves. "This is not theplace  for us,"  he  says.  "We  are not ready.""I  have  a  strong  feeling  that  we  must  turnback,"  says Dr.  Vivaldi.
            "Yes," you say,  "I have the same feeling.  Someforce  is  pulling  us  back."
            Dr.  Vivaldi's gaze is fixed on the Shining Moun-tains. "The  Flying  Clera  are  a  very  advancedspecies,"  she  explains.  "They  have  the  ability toproject their feelings onto  us.  Their presence  andpurpose  here  is  a  mystery  that I  suspect we  arenot yet ready to understand,  but I feel certain thatthey  represent  a  force  of good  in the  universe."
            "If the Flying Clera are so advanced," you say,

        <p>"why  don't  they  rule  the  Underground  King-dom?"Dr.  Vivaldi  smiles.  "I don't know,  but I wouldguess  that  not  wanting  to  rule  others  is  part  ofbeing  advanced."
            At that moment you  are  overcome  by  a  strongdesire to return home, to the surface of the earth.You exchange glances with Dr.  Vivaldi.  "Do youhave the  same  feeling I  do?"  you ask.
            She  nods  and  motions  you to  follow.</p>
