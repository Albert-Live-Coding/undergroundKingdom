"I  won't have  anything  to  do  with yourbrakpa,"  you say.  "I am not an enemy of you orof the Archpods.""Ig krig zaark!" the High Raka says angrily.
Two Raka guards seize you and march you outof  the  agon.  But  the  moment  you  get  outside,you  make  a  break.  You've  always  been  able  torun fast when you needed to.  In the light gravity,you're  even  faster. As  you dart  through thegroves of duster-leaf trees,  you can hear the criesof the Rakas from both sides and behind you. Butthe  Great  River  lies  just  ahead, and  for  onceyou're in luckâ€”there's a crude raft tied  up alongthe  shore.  You  quickly  untie  it,  and  push  off  asyou  jump  aboard.  The  current  soon  takes  youaround a bend in the river and safely out of sight.
You  lie  low  on  the  raft,  afraid  of landing  untilyou are well past Rakmara. Now you have time tothink. Where will the river take you? What will beyour  fate?
