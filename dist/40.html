            The scene around you reminds you of a photo-graphic  negative.  All the  shades and colors seemreversed. The  ground  is  grayish  pink  clay  withwhite  outcroppings.  In the  distance  you can  seeareas that glow like beds of hot coals. Nearby is aforest of trees with green trunks and white leaves.The  trees  are  short;  yet  their  branches,  takingadvantage of the light gravity, spread out for hun-dreds  of feet  in  all  directions.
            You  climb  a  small  hill  to  get  a  better  view.Wherever you look, the land curves upward, as ifyou were standing in the bottom of an enormousbowl. The  sky  is  covered  with  what  looks  likereddish  yellow clouds.
            Most  amazing  of all  is  the  sight  directly  over-headâ€”a  disc  almost  the size  of  the  sun; but,instead  of shining  brightly,  it  is  absolutely  black.You  can  feel  its  coolness,  as  if it  were  drawingheat  from  your  skin. It's  the  black  hole  at  thecenter  of the  earth!
            You  turn  sharply  at  the  sound  of  chattering.Coming  up  the  ravine  are  more  than  a  dozencreatures,  smaller  than  you,  yet walking  uprighton two  legs.  Half human,  half ape, they look likecreatures  that  might  have once lived on  theearth's surface.  They are carrying ropes and nets
