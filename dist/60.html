            Hours  later  you  awake,  stiff and  shaking  fromthe  cold.  Cautiously  you  pull  off your  blindfold.Your  captors  are  gone.  All  around  you  is  darkbrown clay.  There are no trees,  no water,  and noshelter  from  the  cold  wind  that  blows  across thevast,  empty plain.  So this is your intended fateâ€”you will be left to die of exposure under the BlackSun.
            It's a long trek across the desert of the  Under-ground Kingdom, but if you can only reach sometrees,  you  may  be  able  to  find  a  warm  place  torest.  Somehow  you  know  that you'll  make  it,  ifyou have the will.
            Do you?
