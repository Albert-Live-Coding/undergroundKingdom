            The  Grand  Akpar  paces from  one  side  of theagon to the other.  Rnally he stops and stares intoyour eyes. You shrink back from his stern gaze.  "Iwill try what you  suggest,"  he says.  "Meanwhileyou will be kept under guard with Dr.  Vivaldi.  Ifall  goes  well,  you  shall  be  freed,  and we  will  doeverything  we  can  to  make  you  happy  here.When  you  are  ready  to  return  to  the  NetherWorld,  we shall  help  you."
            You  start  to  thank  the  Grand  Akpar,  but  heholds  up  his  hand.  "Do  not thank  me  until  I  tellyou this: If we are betrayed and the Rakas attack,you and Dr.  Vivaldi will die."
            There is not much you can say, and you wouldhardly  have  time  anyway,  for the guards quicklylead you away,
