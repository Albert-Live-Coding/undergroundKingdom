            Hoping for the  best,  you follow the  blue-furredRaka  to  the  center  of the  village.  As  you  walkalong  the  narrow  footpaths,  other  Rakas  emergefrom  their agons  and  stare  at you  curiously.
            When  you  reach  the  central  agon  the  blue-furred  Raka  lets  out  a  long,  low  hooting  noise,which  is  answered  from  within. Inside  an  oldwhite-headed Raka  sits  near the  central  fountain.A large black disc hangs from his neck. For a long
            time  he  stares  at  you.  Finally  he  rises  and  stepscloser.  "So, you are what my hunters found.  Myname is Arton.  I am the High Raka of the villageof Rakmara."

            "Dr. Vivaldi? She's alive? Where?"The  old  Raka  shakes  his  head.  "She  tried  toswim across the Great River. The river spirits haveswallowed  her."
            "She might have made  it across!"  you say.
            "Even if she did, the Archpods would have fedher to the  Kota  beasts."
            "What are Archpods?""The  Archpods  live  beyond  the  Great  River.For  a  long  time  the  Rakas  and  Archpods  haveeach  had one  hunting boat;  that is the law.  Nowthe  Archpods  build  many  boats.  They  are  nothunting boats; they are war boats.  The Archpodsplan  to  conquer  Rakmara."
            You  hold  your  head  in  your  hands.  Poor  Dr.Vivaldi!  And  now the  threat of war
