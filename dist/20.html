            You decide not to risk the treacherous climb tothe surface.  Surely help is on the way.  You huddleon the icy ledge,  stamping your feet and clappingyour hands,  trying to  keep warm.  You feel  yourbody  temperature  dropping.  You've  got  to  stayawake  until  a  search  party  arrives.
            The hours pass slowly.  The sun dips below thehorizon, but there is still light in the sky. Straining,you think you hear something.  .  .  .Pocka pockapocka  pocka  pocka  .  .  .  overhead.  A  chopper  isHovering over the crevasse!  For a moment you'reblinded  by  a  searchlight.  The  chopper  drops  tojust  a  few  yards  above  you.  The  crew  lowers  aharness.  Eagerly you grab it and buckle it aroundyou.
            "HOLD  ON.  WE'RE  PULLING  YOU  UP."Beautiful  words  over  the  bullhorn. You're  sud-denly yanked into the air.  Moments later a pair ofhands  pulls  you  through  the  hatch. The  pilotpours  you  a  cup  of hot  chocolate from his  Ther-mos.
            "Thanks  for  staying  alive  till  we  got  here,"  hesays with a grin.
            You soon feel life seeping back into your body."Thanks  for  pulling  me  out!"
            "This  is  the  one  place  in  the  world  everyoneshould  stay  away  from,"  the  pilot  says.
            "Nothing  could  get  me  back  here,"  you  say.</p>
