            "Let's  get  to  those  diamonds,"  you  cry.  Andyou run toward the points of sparkling white light.
            At the  same  time  you  begin  choking  on  thicksulphurous  fumes.  Behind you,  thunder rumblesfrom the ground!
            Dr. Vivaldi has  reached  the  first  hill  of  dia-monds.  "They're the real thing!"  she calls,  siftingthem through  her hands.  "Within a  few yards ofus  are  more  diamonds than  are  worn  by  all  thepeople  on  earth!"
            "Look!" you shout, for now the fields of whiteclay  are  bubbling  like  boiling  soup.  Pale  yellowgases  rise  from cracks  in the  ground.
            "We  are  trapped."  Dr.  Vivaldi's  voice  soundsfar away.  "By the time the claybeds stop erupting,these fumes will.  .  . p u t . . . u s . . . t o . . .  sleep. "She coughs and staggers a few feet up a small  hillof  diamonds.  "Quick,  over  here!"  she  calls.
            Gasping,  you  stumble  up the  hill  and  collapsein  a  mound  of  diamonds.  Dr. Vivaldi  breathesdeeply. "We're  safe  for the  moment  This  hill  iswell above the toxic gases." Her voice is drownedout  by  the  ground  thunder.
