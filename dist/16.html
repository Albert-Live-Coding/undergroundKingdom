        The angel bird glides through the canyons andcorridors beneath the earth. It increases its speed,and  you  hold  tight  as  it  swoops  through  long,curving passageways. It's the most exciting ride ofyour  life,  and  would  certainly  be  the  scariest  ifyou  didn't  feel  that  you've  never  been  safer.
        Then, ahead of you,  is a tunnel that flares outinto  a  broad  new  world.  An  endless  landscapestretches before you.  It is bathed in soft,  reddishlight, as if the sun had just set everywhere aroundyou!
        A  great river forms  a  curving  line  that  dividesthe  land.  Trees line its banks.  Farther back fromthe river are  mountains,  some  of them  lavenderor  blue  and  others  that  flicker  like  glowing  em-bers.  Strangely  there  is  no  horizon;  instead  thelandscape fades into dusky reds and browns thatcurve over your head, forming a sky that is almostthe same color as the ground.  Directly above youis  something  that  looks  like  the  sun,  but  it  isabsolutely  black!
        So this is the Underground Kingdomâ€”strange,vast, and very beautiful. What people or creatureslive  here?  What mysteries  does it hold? But youare swept from your daydreaming by the realiza-tion  that your life  here  could  be  in  danger</p>
