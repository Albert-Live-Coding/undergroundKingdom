    <p>You are standing on the Toan Glacier in north-ern  Greenland,  staring down  into  the  black voidof  the  crevasse.  You  shiver  as  you  wonderwhether you were lucky or unlucky to be invitedon  this expedition.
        Standing next to you are Gunnar Larsen of theNational Research Institute and Dr. James Sneed,a geologist. A small black box containing a signaltransmitter is suspended over the crevasse by twolong poles. The transmitter is wired to a console afew yards away in the ice.  Dr.  Sneed turns a dialas  he  monitors the  display screen.
        "Well?"  Larsen's voice is impatient.
        Sneed  looks  up,  a  broad  smile  on  his  face."This is it,  friendsâ€”the Bottomless Crevasse."
        "Any radar  return?"  Larsen  asks.
        Sneed shakes his  head.  "None."For  a  minute  no  one  speaks.  Like  you,  theothers  must  feel  excited  to  have  reached  theirgoal but also a little sad. It was just a year ago thatyour  old  friend,  Dr.  Nera  Vivaldi,  radioed  fromthis  spot  that  she  had  reached  the  BottomlessCrevasse.  A  few  moments  later,  her  radio wentdead.  She  was never seen again.</p>
