            "I don't believe the Archpods are running fromnothing,"  you  say.  "Let's get out of here!""OK!" Dr.  Vivaldi starts back across the field ofwhite  clay,  and you  are  right behind  her.
            Running  as  fast as you  can,  still  loaded  downby  your  pack,  you  feel  a  rumbling  beneath  yourfeet. The  ground  begins  to  split  apart. Greatslivers  of clay  are  heaved  up.  Wide  cracks  openaround you.  You think back to when you fell intothe Bottomless Crevasse in Greenland.  This timethere  may  be  no  escape.
            You see Dr.  Vivaldi crawling on her hands andknees, trying to work her way from the edge of acrevice.  The  ground  is  shaking  so  hard you  canno  longer  stand.  The  air is filled with  yellowishhaze  as  sulphurous  fumes  escape  from  beneaththe surface.  Looking up, you see the blurred grayform  of a  wolf looming  as  large  as  a  mountain,crowding out half the sky! Its bared, curving teethare like rows of elephant tusks. Its hot breath takesyour breath  away,  and  the  red world around  yougoes  black.
