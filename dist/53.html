        Once  you've  caught  your  breath,  you  walkalong  the  river  bank  and  soon  reach  a  crudewooden  dock. Two  Rakas  are  guarding  theirhunting boat, a long flat-bottomed shell fashionedfrom duster-leaf wood.  Nearby is a smaller boat,one you could paddle yourself. You just might beable to untie it, push off,  and get across the  riverbefore  the  guards catch  you.
