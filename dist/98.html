        "We  mustn't  waste  time," says  Dr.  Vivaldi."The Bottomless Crevasse closes a bit more everyday."
        Led by the Archpod guide, you begin the longtrek  back to  the  Great River.
        Six  tides  have  passed  before  your  party  de-scends  the  mountain  trail  into  the  valley  of theGreat  River. You  are  eager  to  get  back  to  theBottomless  Crevasseâ€”your  only  hope  of return-ing to the surface of the earth and home. As youstrain your eyes, looking for the Raka village, yousee  two  figures  headed  toward  you  up  the  trail.They're  human!
        "Can it be?"  you cry.
        Dr.  Vivaldi  stares through  her mini-binoculars."No  doubt  about  it," she  says, "Larsen  andSneed!  They made it here alive!"
