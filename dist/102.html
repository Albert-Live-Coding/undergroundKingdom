        "I'm  worried  we  won't  make  it,"  you  say."Maybe  the  eruptions  will  end  soon,  if  we  justwait here awhile."
        "Maybe so," Dr. Vivaldi observes without look-ing at you.  "And  maybe it will get worse."
        The  two  of  you  sit,  waiting.  Soon  a  breezebegins to blow.  A minute later you are coughingand  sputtering  as  the  toxic  gases  rise  over  yourhill.
