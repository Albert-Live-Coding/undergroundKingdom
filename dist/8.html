    <p>You  run  as  fast  as  you  can,  hoping that  oncethe  mother  sees  her  baby  is  safe,  she  will  notpursue  you.
        You  dart  into  a  cavern.  It's  darker  and  hotterthan the pleasant spot where you found the fledg-ling. Is it  the same passageway you camethrough?
        Still running, you look back over your shoulderto  see  if  the  mother  bird  is  following.  At  thatmoment you find yourself falling,  or rather  rising,toward  the  earth's  surfaceâ€”drawn  up  into  whatmust be the same shaft that forms the BottomlessCrevasse!
        Soon you stop rising and start falling. Then yourise  a  shorter  distance,  stop,  and  begin  to  fallagain.  You  feel  like  a  yo-yo,  bouncing  up  anddown, up and down, until you finally come to restat the center of gravity,  the point where you willneither  rise  nor  fall.  Like  a  cork  thrown  in  theocean,  you  seem  doomed  to  drift  forever</p>
