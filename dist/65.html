    <p>You try to row back to the Rakmara shore, butthe current is  now so swift that you find yourselfbeing carried downstream.  Desperately you try topaddle  against  it  It's  no  use.  And  there's  badtrouble  up  aheadâ€”foaming,  white  rapids!  Youhang on for your life, but your raft smashes into arock with a terrific thunk. One end tilts straight up,dumping you into the  wild,  swirling waters.  Youtry  to  grab  the  raft,  but you  can't  reach  it.  Youstart swimming toward shore, but you can't makeany  headway.
        You're not a quitter.  You'll go down trying.</p>
