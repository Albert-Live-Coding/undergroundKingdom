    <p>"Hurry!" you yell.
        A moment later you see Dr. Sneed's reassuringface  on  one  side  of  the  opening  above  you.Larsen peers over the other side.  "Don't worry,"he calls.
        "Hey,  what's..." Dr.  Sneed's voice is cut off ashe  slides  over  the  icy  lip  of  the  crevasse.  Youwatch  with  horror  as  his  body  hurtles  by,  downinto the  abyss!
        You  yell  at Larsen  to get back from  the  edge.But a blur whirls by, and you feel the rush of air ashis  body  plummets  after  Sneed's.
        They're  both  gone,  and  now  you  are  alone,trapped  on  a  narrow  icy  ledge.  If  only  you  hadwarned  them,  you  would  have  saved  them  andprobably  yourself  too.
        Now your chances look slim. A search helicop-ter  might  fly  over.  But  will  it  land?  Will  anyoneever  find  you  down  here?  Will  you  even  survivethe  arctic  night?</p>
