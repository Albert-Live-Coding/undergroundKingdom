        <p>
            Your  raft  floats  on  past  marshy  banks  andyellow clay islands.  The river grows  narrow  as itflows  through a  deep canyon.  Rock cliffs rise upon  both  sides.  You  hold  on,  hoping  to  reach  aplace  where  you  can  land.
            Never have you experienced as dark a night asthis.  It's  as  if  the  river  were  flowing  through  atunnel somewhere  in the  depths of the earth.
            Finally you sleep, and it seems as if a very longtime  has  passed when  you  awake  and find yourraft  pitching  up  and  down.  Why  has  the  rivergrown  so  rough?  It's  still  too  dark  to  see  much,but at least the  stars are  out.
            Stars?  There  aren't  any  stars  in  the  Under-ground Kingdom. You're not on the riverâ€”you'reon  an  ocean!
