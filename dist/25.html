        You  force  yourself to  keep  walking. If  youwander too  far from the  crevasse,  a  search  teammight  miss  you,  so  you  walk  in  a  large  square:fifty paces north .  .  . fifty east.  .  . fifty south .  .  .fifty west  .  .  .  fifty  north  .  .  .  again  .  .  .  again.Your legs  feel  like  lead.  Your  eyes  are  half shut.You hardly notice when the weak arctic sun reap-pears  . . .  the sun  .  .  .  you can't think  .  .  .  dizzy.  .  . you can't stand.  .  .  .
        It seems like another world when you wake  upin a room with pale green walls and gleaming tilefloors.  Your  head  is  swimming.  What  happenedto Larsen and Sneed? You feel as if you've livedthrough  a  nightmare.
        "You're lucky,  we were able to save your leg."A  tall,  bearded  doctor  is  speaking. "You'll  beOK."  Then  his voice trails off as  he tells you thatyour friends,  Gunnar Larsen and Dr.  Sneed,  havejoined Dr.  Vivaldi,  all  lost forever.
        "Larsen . . . Sneed." You keep mumbling theirnames  until finally sleep  comes.
        By  morning  your  head  has  cleared.  It  was  aterrible ordeal,  but at least you survived.  In a fewweeks you'll  be  homeâ€”home  for good,  becausenothing  could  ever  persuade  you  to  go  near  theBottomless  Crevasse  again!</p>
