            "Look  at  all  those  diamonds,"  you  say. "I'msurprised  the  Archpods  haven't  already  takenthem."
            "Villa tarem, zaark!" One of the Archpods isscreaming. Several  of them  point  to  the  north."Tarem Agax!"
            You can't see  anything  unusual,  but the Arch-pods  are  deserting  you,  racing  back  across  thefield.
            "What's going on? Do you see anything?"  youask Dr.  Vivaldi.
            She  shakes  her head,  seemingly as confused asyou are.  "It must be the ghost wolf.  What we arewitnessing  may  be more  interesting than the  dia-mond  hills  themselves.  We  may  be  in the  pres-ence of a life force that the Archpods can see butwe  can't  Or maybe  what they  see  is  an  illusion,and we are right in thinking nothing is there.  Thisis something that has always interested me:  differ-ent  realities  for  different  observers."
            "I  don't  think  we  have  time  to  figure  it  outnow,"  you say.
            "You may be right," Dr. Vivaldi admits.  "In anyevent, I would guess that the Archpods have goodreasons  for  their  fears.  Are  you  willing  to  riskcontinuing on to the Hills of Diamonds, or do youwant to  turn  back?"
