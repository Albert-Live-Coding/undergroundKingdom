        You  step  forward  to  meet  the  strange  proces-sion. The  underworld  creatures  form  a  circlearound you,  cackling and gesturing to each other.
        You  smile  and  hold  out  your  arms. "Hello,"you  begin,  but the  creatures  raise  their  nets  andclose  in  on  you. One  of them  barks  an  order.They  motion  for  you  to  follow  them.  You  don'thave  much  choice.  Despite  their  small  size,  theymove rapidly through the thick woods.  Occasion-ally  they  freeze,  and  you  hear  them  whispering,"Kota, ib saben Kota."
        You march a mile or so through groves of trees.It's as hot as you've ever known it, and you feel asif you're going to faint, but finally you reach openland.  Instantly you  feel  cooler.  The  Black  Sun  isdrawing  heat  from  your  body.
        Soon you reach a village of igloo-shaped struc-tures  that  look  as  if they're  made  of green  clay.One of your captors leads you to the nearest one."Ib  agon," he  says as he takes you inside
