"But what does that have to do with the blackhole?"  you  ask Bruckner.The  professor pauses to  fill  his  pipe.  "As  I ex-plained in my published theory,  a tiny black holelodged  in  the  center  of  the  earth  more  than  abillion  years  ago.  It  pulled  the  interior  of  theearth—everything  except for  the  crust  and  man-tle—into itself, leaving the earth hollowed out likea  Halloween  pumpkin.  That  is  what  the  gravityreadings tell us."
"Then  where  is the  Underground Kingdom?"
"It  is  the  whole  interior  surface  of  the  earth.And  if  you  stood  there  and  looked  straight  up,you  would  see  the  black  hole. It  would  lookexactly  like  our  sun  except  that  it  would  be  jetblack."
Professor Bruckner lights his pipe, then says,  "Idid not expect to undertake this mission for somemonths.  I  only  planned  to  inspect  the  crevasseand test the Vertacraft, but the crevasse is closingrapidly.  I  must  make  the  descent  today.  Other-wise,  my return path might be blocked.  Who willvolunteer to come  with  me?""
