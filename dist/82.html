            "If there's a chance of making it,"  you say,  I'dlike to try to get home.""Then we  must hurry,"  says  Dr.  Vivaldi.  "Ak-par,  there is not much you can do but lead us tothe  crater where  we  arrived."
            The Grand Akpar speaks in his own tongue toa guard, who quickly leaves the chamber. Turningto  you  he  says,  "I  shall  have  a  boat  readied  totake you across the Great River.  Come then,  wewill guide you  back to  the  secret canyon."
            After a three-tides' journey you and Dr. Vivaldi,guided by a party of Archpods, reach the Bottom-less  Crevasse.  Dr.  Vivaldi  runs  toward  a  smallmetal  craft on  the  crater  floor.
            "A Vertacraft!" she says. "With luck this will getus  back  to  the  earth's  surface."Dr.  Vivaldi  gives instructions to  the  Archpods,who  then  use  their  ropes  to  suspend  the  craftdirectly over the shaft of the crevasse. You and Dr.Vivaldi  thank  your  hosts  and  bid  them  farewell.The canopy cover closes. You watch anxiously asDr.  Vivaldi checks out the instruments.  "Are youready?"  she asks.
            "Ready."  You  grit your  teeth  as the  Vertacraftaccelerates into the crevasse and begins the 800-mile  descent  to  the  surface  of  the  earth.  You'repressed flat against your seat.  The g force  is ter-rific!  It's getting worse.  What's  happening? Can'tDr.  Vivaldi stop it? You're blacking out.
