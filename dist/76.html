            Now three tides have passed.  You and Dr.  Vi-valdi  are  still  waiting  for  the  news  that  will  sealyour  fate.It must be midway through the second sleepingtide  when  the  guards  awaken  you.  A  momentlater, the Grand Akpar walks into your agon. Withhim is the  High  Raka.
            "The  Archpods  and  the  Rakas  have  madepeace," says Akpar.  "From now on we shall buildboats  for  both  tribes, and  there  shall  be  nobombs!"
