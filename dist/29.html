        Three  weeks later  you  find  yourself  staringonce  again  at the  Bottomless  Crevasse.
        "It  looks  narrower than  when  I  was  here  be-fore,"  you  remark.
        "Yes," Bruckner  says, "the  glacier  has  beenadvancing  about  three  feet  a  year. It  won't  belong  before  the  crevasse  is  completely  sealed."
        While  you  and  the  other members  of the  partystand  at  a  safe  distance,  the  professor  cautiouslywalks  to  the  rim  of the  crevasse.  In  one  hand  heholds  an  oblong  instrument  that  emits  an  in-creasingly  rapid  clicking.
        "Don't get too  close!"  you  cry.
        "Indeed."  Bruckner takes  a few  steps  back. "Ithink  I  know  what  happened  to  Larsen,  Sneed,and  Vivaldi."
        "What?""Gravity  waves  coming  from  the  center  of  theearth  have  disrupted  space-time  enough  to  pullthem  in." The  professor  looks  down  into  yourpuzzled  face. "And you,  as well,"  he  adds. "I'vealways  suspected that the  laws  of physics  may  bedifferent  in  the  vicinity  of  a  black  hole.  Now  wehave proof!"
        "What does  this  mean?"The professor smiles. "It means that the interiorof the  earth—beginning  about  800  miles  deep—is hollow."</p>
