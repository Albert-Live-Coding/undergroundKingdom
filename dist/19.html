You know how you feel: the risks don't matter.You want to explore the  Underground Kingdom!
The  angel  bird  seems  to  understand.  Steeplybanking, it swoops down along the great river andglides  gently  onto  a  mossy  plain.  Nearby  is  agrove  of  tall  trees.  Short  stumpy  branches  withclusters  of  multicolored  leaves  thrust  out  fromtheir trunks.  They look almost like hands holdingbunches of flowers.
You slide to the ground,  and at once the angelbird rises in  the  air.  As it glides  up into the darkred sky, you feel a wave of happiness. You followits  path  with  your  eyes  long  after  it  has  disap-peared. Then,  turning to survey the strange land-scape,  you  wonder  where  you  will  go.  Whatdangers await you?</p>
