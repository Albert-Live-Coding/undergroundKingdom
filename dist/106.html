        It's an avalanche all right, but the boulders arerolling  up  the  mountain! Panicked, you  runtoward  Katu.  The  boulders  are  coming  right  atyou.  At  near  zero  gravity  they're  being  pulledtoward  the  Black  Sun.
        "You've got to run  down!"  Dr.  Vivaldi shouts.But the boulders have cut off your escape. Theonly  thing  you  can  do  is  run  up  the  mountain,trying  to  keep  out  of  their  path.  You're  runninghigher  and  faster,  leaping  fifty  feet  at  a  time.Ahead of you,  Katu flies off the mountain.  Beforeyou  can  stop  yourself  your  feet  lose  touch  withthe  ground,  and  you're  in  the  air,  being  swepthigher and higher, straight toward the Black Sun!
        You've  read that a black hole  might somehowbe  an  entrance  to  another  universe.  If  only  thatwere  possible!  It's  your  only  chance  once  youreach  the  Black  Sun.  A  chance  in  a  millionmaybe,  but still a chance .  .  .
