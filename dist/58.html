        You  think  fast. Luckily,  you  remember  thecommand  that  the  blue-furred  Raka  gave.  Youwalk up  to the  guards,  smiling.  You  point in  thedirection  you  came  from,  then  to  yourself,  andthen to one  of the boats.
        "Nar mg calla," you say with authority.
        The guards mutter. Then, to your surprise, theysmile.  One of them unties a boat and motions foryou  to  board  it.  They  must  think  you're  a  privi-leged  guest  of  the  High  Raka.  You  quickly  getaboard  and  push  off.
        As  the current takes  you  around  a  bend,  younotice  Archpod  settlements  on  the  oppositeshore.  Soon  you  spot a  good  landing  place.  Asyou  get  closer,  you  notice  a  band  of  Archpodsstanding  on  the  shore.  Like  the  first  Rakas  youmet,  they  are  armed  with  ropes  and  nets.  Theydon't look very friendly.  You could be in for moretrouble  than  you  had with the  Rakas.
