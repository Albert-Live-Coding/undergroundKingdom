        You  push  the  Emergency-Reverse  button.  In-stantly  you  are  pressed  to  your  seat,  almostcrushed  by  the  forces  as  the  retro-rockets  fire.The artificial weight squeezes the air out of yourlungs.  Then,  slowly,  the  pressure  eases.  For  amoment you're completely weightless. Your heartis  pounding  as you  check the  depth  meter.  TheVertacraft is  rising!
        "You  fool.  What  have  you  done?"  Brucknersounds wilder than  ever.
        "I'm  returning  us  to  the  surface,  Professor."Your voice  is  cool.  You  feel  confident  now  thatthe  Vertacraft  has  responded  to  your  command.
        "Why didn't you ask?"  Bruckner's voice is bit-ter.  "The  auto-return  isn't programmed to  adjustfor this  gravitation."
        Bruckner sounds more sane now. It's you who'sbeginning to feel crazy.  "What will happen then?"you  ask.
        Suddenly the  darkness is replaced by blindingsunlight.  The  Vertacraft  has  reached  the  surface,yet it's still accelerating, shooting up into the strat-osphere!
        "Can't we  bring it back  down?"
        "I'm  afraid  not, my  foolish  young  friend,"Bruckner  replies  in  a  cold,  dead  tone. "It's  acommand procedure. There's no override.  We'reheaded into outer space.  Within a few hours we'llbe  frozen  solid."
