        You  bury  the  professor's  body  near  the  Ver-tacraft,  and  say  a  prayer.  You  feel  sad  and  afraidof setting forth alone in a strange world. But thereis  no choice.  You must search for food  and  shel-ter.
        First, you've got to get out of this crater. Thereis a tunnel  nearby.  Peering inside,  you see that itleads  straight down.  Suddenly  you  realize  that itwas  through  this  tunnel  that  the  Vertacraft  trav-eled; you're looking through the other end of theBottomless  Crevasse. The  tunnel  doesn't  leadstraight  down,  but  straight  up—to  the  surface  ofthe  earth!
        So  Professor  Bruckner was  right.  The  earth  islike  a  hollowed-out  pumpkin,  and  you're  stand-ing  on  its  inner  shell.  Your  feet  must  be  held  tothe  ground  by  the  gravity  of the  shell  itself.
        You look around at the walls of the crater. Theyare too steep to climb.  But you feel so light—as ifyou  were  walking  on  the  moon—you  might  beable to jump  out.
        You  stand there  a minute,  wondering why thepull  of gravity  here  isn't  as  strong  as  it is  on  theearth's  surface. Then  you  remember  the  rest  ofBruckner's  theory: There  is  a  black  hole  at  thecenter  of the  earth,  pulling  you  toward  it.  Youleap  as  high  as  you  can—twenty  feet  in  the  air!Then, with one great bound, you're  out,  standingon  the  surface  of the  Underground  Kingdom.
