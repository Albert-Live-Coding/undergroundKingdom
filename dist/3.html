        Your consciousness  slips  away  as you fall fasterdown,  down,  down.The  next thing you know, you're floating in air.In the  soft,  reddish  light you  can  see  that you  arein a cavern,  drifting toward the ceiling—or is it thefloor?  In a flash you realize what has  happened—you've fallen to a point where gravity above youis almost equal to gravity beneath you!
        You  brush  against  a  firm  surface—a  wall  thatfeels like clay.  You cling to it for a moment.  Thenyou're  floating  again,  drifting  slowly  down. Youbegin to  lose  your fear as  you  realize  that gravityhere  is  so  weak  that you  can fall mile  after  milewithout  being hurt  After  a  while  you  begin  torelax  and  enjoy  drifting  through  a  fantastic  twi-light world. You only wish it weren't so hot! Clos-ing  your  eyes,  you  try  to  pretend  that  you  aresafely  home  in  bed</p>
