        "I'll  face the  Grand Akpar with you.""That's a brave choice," says Dr. Vivaldi, "but italso  would  have  taken  courage  to  escape."  Shesmiles.  "Sometimes  there's  nothing to  do  but tobe  brave!"  As  she speaks three Archpod guardswalk into the agon. They motion for you to followthem,  but when Dr.  Vivaldi tries to join you, theyblock  her way.
        "Good  luck.  . . . "  Dr.  Vivaldi's  voice  fades  asthe  guards  march you  out of the  agon.
        A  few  minutes  later  you  are  standing  in  thecentral agon.  Facing you is the Grand Akpar.  Hislong, silky  fur  is  combed  like  an  oval  framearound  his stern,  gray  face.  A pendant made  ofsmooth  black stone  hangs  from  his  neck.
        He studies you a moment and says,  "We havelearned from  Dr.  Vivaldi that you come from theNether  Worldâ€”the  world  of warfare.  You  knowmuch  more  about such  things  than  we  do.  Youcan prove that you  are not a  Raka spy  by tellingus  how we  can  defeat them!"
        You stand silently, trying to think of what to say."I'm waiting,"  the  Grand Akpar says.What will you do?
