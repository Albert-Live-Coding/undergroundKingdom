        In  a flash you're  over the  side  and  swimmingfor  shore.  The  Rakas  yell  at  you.  One  of  themtries to hit you with an oar while the others strokefuriously, trying  to  turn  their  unwilling  craftaround.
        Swimming  hard,  you  hear  screams  behindyou.  The  war  boat  has  overturned!  The  brakpahave  gone  to  the  bottom,  and  the  Rakas  arestruggling  to  save  their  lives  and  right  the  boat.Using all your strength, you swim in to shore andstart running  for the  groves  of duster-leaf trees.
        Almost  at  once  you  hear a  loud,  trilling  song.Above  you  is  an  enormous flying creature  withwings stretching twenty feet across! You stare intoits  great  blue-green  eyes  and  at  once  feel  com-pletely safe.  You know you've seen it,  or at leastdreamed of seeing it, before. It's like some kind ofangel  bird  sent to  protect you.  Without thinking,you leap right onto  the  creature's  back.
