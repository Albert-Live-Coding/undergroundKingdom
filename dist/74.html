            Your  head  aches.  You  feel  as  if  you've  beenrun  over by a  steamroller  . . .  but a cool  hand ispressed  against  your  forehead.
            "Don't  worry,  you're  going  to  be  OK," Dr.Vivaldi says.  "The  radio worked.  Help is on  theway."
            Your  face  is  bruised.  It's  painful  just  openingyour  eyes,  but  well  worth  it.  For  in  the  brightsunlight  you  can  see  ice  fields  all  around  you.You're  back  in  Greenland,  and  right  now  thewhole surface  of the  earth  feels  like  home!
            You look up at Dr. Vivaldi.  Her face shows she,too,  is  in  pain.  "A  broken  arm,"  she  explains."Otherwise,  I'm  OK."
            "We were lucky,"  you say.
            "Yes." She smiles. "The Vertacraft  Justsqueaked  through.  The  crevasse  has  narrowedtwo  more  feet.  In  another  few  weeks  it  will  beimpossible to get through. You and I will probablybe  the  last  ones  ever  to  visit  the  UndergroundKingdom."
            "I'm  glad  we  had  the  chance,"  you  say. "Iwouldn't have  missed it for the world."
