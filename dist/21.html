            There is no shelter from the relentless wind andno  sign  of  Larsen  or  Sneed.  It's  getting  hard  tobreathe.  You  soon  begin  to  feel  the  dull  aches,stiffness,  and sick feeling you've read aboutâ€”thedread  symptoms  of  hypothermia;  you  are  freez-ing to death. Maybe a search helicopter will arriveany  moment.  Maybe  in  a  few  hours.  Maybenever.
            You are very tired.  You desperately need rest.
