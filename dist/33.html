        Hank  Crouter,  Bruckner's  assistant,  glances  athis  watch.  "If  he  survives,  we'll  get  a  signal  backwithin ten  minutes,"  he  says.
        You  all  wait  anxiously,  watching  the  clock,watching the crevasse.  Ten minutes go by,  fifteen,twenty, twenty-five.  A chilling wind  bites throughyour  parka.  You  kick the  icy  ground.
        "Thirty  minutes," says  Crouter. "There's  noway .  .  ."
        Weary and  sad,  your party trudges  back acrossthe ice fields. The moving glacier is rapidly closingthe  crevasse. There  won't be  another chance.
