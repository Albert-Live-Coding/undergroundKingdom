    <p>
        You  inch  your  way  along  the  edge,  keepingyour  body  flat  against  the  wall  of  the  crevasse.You  should  be  able  to  make  it,  as  long  as  youdon't panic.  You try not to look down.
        After  almost an  hour  of slow  progress,  you'reable  to  raise  a  hand  over  the  rim.  But  you  stillcan't  pull  yourself  up.
        You hack away at the ice,  gouging out anotherhandhold,  then  another  foothold.  It  seems  likehours before you can take even one step higher.Then,  with  one  great  effort,  you  heave  yourselfover the edge,  then twist and roll  away from thedeadly  opening.
        Stiff and shaky,  you manage to stand and stareat the  bleak  world around  you.  The sun  has  setbehind the western mountains,  and you begin toshiver in the chill wind. You're thankful that in thispart of Greenland it never grows dark in July. Butit  does  grow  cold—well  below  freezing—andyou're  too  exhausted  to  run  and jump  to  warmyourself.</p>
