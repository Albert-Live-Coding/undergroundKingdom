        Trying  to  act  unafraid,  you  row  straight  in  toshore,  hop  out  of the  boat,  and  step  forward  tomeet the Archpods.  "Hello.  I come as a  friend!"you call out. But their only response is to take youprisoner and  march you  back to their village.
        You  soon  find that the Archpods  live in  agonssimilar  to  those  of  the  Rakas.  Your  captors  leadyou into the largest one, where you expect to bepresented  to  their  chief.  Instead,  a  woman  callsyour name.  It's Dr.  Vivaldi</p>

        She hugs you warmly.  "I thought I'd never seeanother  human  face!"  she  cries,  tears  streamingdown  her cheeks.One of the  guards  says something you  cannotunderstand.  Then the Archpods march out of theagon,  leaving  you alone  with  your friend.
        Dr.  Vivaldi  tells  you  how  she  barely  survivedher  fall  through  the  Bottomless  Crevasse,  howshe  lived  for  almost  a  year  with  the  Rakas  andfinally swam across the Great River to the land ofthe Archpods.  You tell her of your descent to theUnderground  Kingdom  and  your  adventures  inRakmara.
        "We  must  set  upon  a  plan,"  she  says.  "TheArchpods have learned that the Rakas are makingbombs. They think we may be Raka spies. That iswhy you were treated so rudely.  They  have toldme  that  their  chief,  the  Grand  Akpar,  will  soondecide whether to execute  us."</p>
