        Three  months  have  passed.  You  return  homelate  one  afternoon  to  find  a  man  waiting at yourfront  door.
        "I'm  Professor  Bruckner. From  the  NationalResearch  Institute  in  Washington."  He  shakesyour  hand  warmly.
        "Please  come  in.  Are  you  still  studying  theBottomless  Crevasse?"
        Bruckner nods.  "We've identified the force thatmay have pulled Larsen and Sneed into the  cre-vasse.  Would you be willing to go back? Precau-tions  would  be  taken  so  there  would  be  nochance  of its  happening again."</p>
        <p>You shake  your  head. "I'm  afraid  not,  Pro-fessor.  I  don't think I  could  go  back to the  placewhere  my  friends  died."
            Smiling, the professor leans toward you."Would it change your mind if I told you that yourfriends  may  still  be  alive?"
            "What?""It's true.  We received faint radio signals from apoint far beneath the  earth's  surface.  I believe thatone  or  more  of  the  others  must  be  alive  some-where in  the  Underground Kingdom, and  wehave  the  means  to  reach  them.  Now  will  youcome?"</p>
