            You quickly reach the boat, but you can't untiethe rope! Instantly the Rakas are upon you. Utter-ing angry cries, they fling their nets over you. Oneof  them  blindfolds  you.  Then  they  march  youalong a  winding,  bumpy  path.
            "Where are you taking me?"  you ask.  But theRakas ignore you,  muttering angrily in their owntongue.
            Death  seems  certain.  How  will  they  executeyou?  They  seem  to  like  ropes;  maybe  they  willhang you.As you march on,  hour after hour, the air turnscolder.  You  feel your strength  ebbing.
            Finally the  Rakas  stop.  Exhausted,  you  crum-ple to the ground.  All is silent, and you fall into adeep  sleep.
