            At the change of tide, Dr. Vivaldi leaves for herinterview with the Grand Akpar.  Only one Raka isleft to guard you.  You hand him the gold bracelet.Taking it,  he smiles broadly.  You hurry past him,but  another  guard  is  standing  outside  the  agon.You wheel past him and run for it.  The  surprisedArchpod yells; you soon hear others chasing you.But in a few moments you reach the shelter of thecluster-leaf groves, and as you go deeper into thewoods,  you  are  relieved  that you  no  longer  hearthe  Archpods  behind  you. It's  strange,though,that they  didn't follow you  into  the  woods.
