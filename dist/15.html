        You run from the angel bird—up a hill that getssteeper  and  steeper. In  the  light  gravity  of theunderworld  you  can  run  faster than  a  deer,  evenup  this  mountain.  Twenty,  thirty,  forty  feet  at  abound!  You feel even lighter than you did before.You try to leap only a few feet in the  air,  but youfind yourself floating. There is no way you can getdown. You  are  entombed  between  the  groundabove  and  the  ground  below.
        You  close  your  eyes.  Then,  instead  of feelingwarm,  you  feel  cold;  instead  of feeling  light,  youfeel  heavy.  Instead  of floating, you're  lying  on  ahard,  cold  surface.  Opening  your  eyes,  you  seeice walls rising above you.
        Now you  understand.  When  you  fell  into  thecrevasse,  you  landed  on  this  ledge,  about thirtyfeet  below  the  surface.  You  must  have  hit  yourhead  on  the  ice.  What  a  strange  dream  you'vehad!  It  seemed  so  real—as  if the  angel  bird  putthe  dream  in  your  head! But  there  are  otherthings  to think of right  now.
        "HELP!"  you  shout
        No one answers.  Larsen and Sneed have prob-ably  given  you  up  for  lost</p>
